# Job-Search-Project
 
This is a starter project to automate job searches. 

The initial boiler-plate code is based on this Medium Article:

https://medium.com/@msalmon00/web-scraping-job-postings-from-indeed-96bd588dcb4b

I have added the scrapping of job posting links and the ability to have user input for a more custom experience.

## TODO:(In no certain order)

- Decide on and add a License
- Add more notes
- Scrape Full job description
- Incorporate NLP for Top Words
- Add DS statiscal Analysis on NLP with visuals
- Import resume for comparison.
- Package code for deployment
- Anything else. Maybe the kitchen sink.
